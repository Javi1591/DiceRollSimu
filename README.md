# DiceRollSimulator

A simple C++ console application that simulates dice‐rolling operations.  
Built with Visual Studio (or your preferred C++ IDE), this project demonstrates basic random number generation, loops, user interaction, and output formatting.

---

## Project Overview

DiceRollSimu simulates rolling one or more dice for a user-specified number of rolls. It then outputs statistics like frequency counts and results distributions. The application covers these fundamentals:
- Random number generation using <code>std::rand</code> / <code><random></code>
- Looping constructs to repeat rolls
- Conditional logic and accumulators to count outcomes
- Clear console output with formatted tables summarizing results

---

## Features

- Prompt user for number of dice and number of rolls  
- Simulate each roll and record the result  
- Display a summary histogram or table of outcomes (e.g., how many times each face appeared)  
- Support for different dice types (six-sided by default; extendable)  
- Basic input validation for user entries

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio (2019/2022) — or any C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
